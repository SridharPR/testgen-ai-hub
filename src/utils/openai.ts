1. **Basic Validation Tests**
   - Verify loan application submission with valid data
   - Test with invalid loan amounts (negative, zero, excessive)
   - Validate required fields (applicant details, loan amount, term)

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Test API access with valid/invalid credentials
   - Verify role-based access (loan officer vs. customer)
   - Test token expiration and refresh mechanisms

3. **Business Logic**
   - Verify credit score evaluation
   - Test interest rate calculation based on terms
   - Validate approval/rejection logic
   - Test loan term calculations

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test API response with malformed requests
   - Verify appropriate error codes for different failure scenarios
   - Test timeout handling

5. **Integration Points**
   - Test integration with credit bureau APIs
   - Verify integration with payment processing systems
   - Test notification systems (email/SMS)

6. **Performance**
   - Test response times for loan application submission
   - Verify handling of concurrent applications
   - Test API throttling mechanisms`,
      
      "Stress Testing": `## Stress Testing Scenarios for Loans

1. **Volume Testing**
   - Process 1000+ simultaneous loan applications
   - Test system behavior during end-of-month peak periods
   - Simulate yearly tax season load patterns

2. **Load Distribution**
   - Test load balancing across multiple application servers
   - Verify database connection pooling under heavy load
   - Test CDN response with high traffic

3. **Recovery Testing**
   - Test system recovery after database failure
   - Verify transaction integrity during network outages
   - Test failover mechanisms during peak loads

4. **Long Duration Tests**
   - Run continuous loan processing for 24+ hours
   - Monitor memory leaks during extended operations
   - Test database growth impact on performance

5. **Resource Limitation Tests**
   - Test with limited CPU resources
   - Verify system behavior with reduced memory
   - Test with constrained database connections

6. **Concurrent User Testing**
   - Simulate 10,000+ concurrent users browsing loan options
   - Test multiple loan officers reviewing applications simultaneously
   - Verify locking mechanisms during concurrent updates`
